The following files are included:

- functions.php
- main.js

When placed in the root of a WordPress theme, the following killer features should be available:

-> When a user is added to WP, a valid image is randomly stored against that user.
-> When a user logs in to WP, their user agent is captured so their last user agent is on record.
-> The WP AJAX URL is made available in the source.
-> Once the site loads, an AJAX call is made to retrieve a nice quote and alert the user.
-> The quote is cached for 30 minutes to limit quote API requests.

Unfortunately, every feature is broken (some in multiple ways).

The previous dev has been launched into space for what he's done, and now it's up to you to make his code work correctly.

ENVIRONMENT

Make sure you're using the following for this exercise:

- WordPress 5+
- PHP 7.3

SUBMISSION

- Use whatever WP theme you like, so long as it contains the included files in the root.
- If your chosen theme already has a functions file, just copy the contents of functions.php to the end of the file.
- You MUST use git for this exercise (treat the theme as the repo).
- Each bug fix MUST be in its own commit.
- Your git repo MUST be accessible by us (use github or bitbucket if you don't host your own).

Contact d+supportdev@hallam.co.uk if you have any questions.
